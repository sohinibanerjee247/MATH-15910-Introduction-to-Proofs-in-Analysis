# MATH-15910-Introduction-to-Proofs-in-Analysis
This course is intended for students who are making the transition from MATH 13300 or 15300 to MATH 20250 and MATH 20300, or for students who need more preparation in learning to read and write proofs. This course covers the fundamentals of theoretical mathematics and prepares students for upper-level mathematics courses beginning with MATH 20250 and MATH 20300. Topics include the axioms for the real numbers, completeness and the least upper bound property, the topology of the real line, and sequences and series of real and complex numbers. Students who are majoring or minoring in mathematics may not use both MATH 15910 and MATH 16300 to meet program requirements.
